# Desipramine-DDGI-Model
Modeling of published clinical desipramine studies for model evaluation

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model for desipramine and its metabolite 2-hydroxydesipramine. The model was developed using published clinical studies and its predictive performance was evaluated within our DDGI network. The file "Desipramine-Model" contains simulations of the published clinical (DGI) studies used during model establishment, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. For further details, quantitative model evaluation, sensitivity analysis and extensive documentation, please refer to [1]. Furthermore, the DD(G)I files contain simulations of published clinical DD(G)I studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of the desirpamine model regarding DD(G)Is with the CYP2D6 perpetrator drugs atomoxetine, bupropion, paroxetine, and quinidine, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. The applied atomoxetine, bupropion, paroxetine, and quinidine models have been published previously [2-4].
